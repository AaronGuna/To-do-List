## Getting Started

To-Do List Application

I created this simple To-Do List application using my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The idea behind this project was to have a handy tool to help me stay organized and ensure I don't miss out on any important tasks throughout the day. With the ability to add tasks, set deadlines, and mark them as completed, this application serves as a practical solution to manage my daily activities effectively
